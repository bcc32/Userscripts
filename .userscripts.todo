# New Ideas
	Can we get Feedly background hotkey working in Firefox, too?
	Replacer/redirector script for emc2summary /1/ URLs, to redirect to proper INI
		Update built-in match URL
		Update readme (all of it)
		Call out where settings are located, etc.
		Is there an on-installation run spot that I could use to create the settings instead of relying on it happening on first run?
